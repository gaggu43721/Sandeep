Jamaica Hospital Medical Center regularly receives letters of thanks from former
 patients or their family members for the high level of care we provide throughout
  our facility. Below are just a few examples of the nice messages we have received. 
  For privacy purposes, we only included the first names of the authors.</font></p><br><br>

I recently found myself under your care for a cardiac issue. 
While there, accompanied by my wife, we found that the entire
 staff at Jamaica Hospital was exceedingly professional and efficient,
  from your E.R. receptionists to the cardiac care team. You should be
   proud of your outstanding staff and service.</font></p>

On behalf of my wife, who was a patient in your hospital,
 I humbly submit my sincere gratitude to the management and
  staff of Jamaica Hospital, especially to your outstanding nurses 
  and PCAs. They have been outstandingly helpful and provided a high
   quality of service, care and comfort to my wife. Thank you.</font></p>

I am writing to express my gratitude from my family for the care given to
 my mother. In the SICU, there was care, compassion, and respect. A special 
 thank you to your social workers as well; they provided professional guidance,
  comfort, and strength to make our own decisions. Finally, I cannot praise the 
  Palliative Care and Hospice team enough. They were patient and helpful.
   All our hope that you continue along this path.</font></p>

My wife and I were recently heading to Florida. While on the jetway,
 my wife told me that she wasn’t feeling well and didn’t think we should
  get on the plane. We were eventually taken to Jamaica Hospital. From the
   moment she was wheeled through the doors of the emergency room, my fears
   were immediately put to rest. A courteous, compassionate and competent group 
   of people immediately enveloped her in a cocoon of security. I would like to 
   tell you that you should be extremely proud of your staff for the manner in 
   which they treated a frightened pair of senior citizens.</font></p>

I was recently cared for at Jamaica Hospital following a heart attack 
while at JFK. I just wanted to say a few words about the exceptional 
care I received in the Jamaica Hospital Cardiac Care Unit and the MICU.
 All of the doctors and nurses were friendly, pleasant, kind, thorough,
  conscientious and professional. I am happy to have been in their care.</font></p>

I was admitted to Jamaica Hospital’s Labor and Delivery Unit and 
I am writing this letter to inform you of my experience.
I was very nervous entering the emergency room. My nervousness 
was reduced when I was greeted with several smiles from your staff.
The doctors and nurses on the Labor Unit were amazing. 
They were patient, kind, and efficient when answering questions. 
Their primary goal was to make sure I was secure. I was convinced
 that they had my best interest at heart and would ensure my safety 
 during surgery. Thanks for hiring such excellent staff.
I want to thank everyone that contributed to taking care of me. 
I loved my experience at Jamaica Hospital and would recommend this 
hospital to family and friends. Keep up the phenomenal work.</font></p>

We would like to let you know how much we appreciate the 
special care our daughter was given by the doctors and staff
 at your hospital. Our baby’s physician was professional, kind,
  understanding, and her treatment was “right on.” Your organization 
  should be proud to have such kind hearted people. They made sure that
   my daughter’s hospitalization was very pleasant.</font></p>

I am writing this letter to thank everyone at your wonderful hospital for
 the excellent care that was given to me. Within minutes of arriving in the
  emergency room I was treated for what was diagnosed as a mild stroke. I want to
    thank the entire staff for the kind and caring assistance I received, including 
  the security guards, ER staff, and the doctors, nurses and aides on the third floor. Everyone!
I have made a remarkable and full recovery thanks to your quick and
 caring staff. I will be forever grateful to everyone for the care I received.</font></p>

I am writing on behalf of my brother who was a patient in your hospital. 
I would like to thank you on behalf of my entire family for the help and
 consideration shown to me in what was a very difficult time. Again, 
 I would like to thank you for the services you provide to patients and their families.</font></p>

My husband was recently admitted to your Emergency Room. After an MRI, he was
 diagnosed with a brain bleed.
The reason I am writing this letter is to let you know of 
the excellent care he received at your hospital. The compassion 
shown to him, and in particular, my family, was beyond anything 
I would have expected from a busy hospital staff.
So many people complain about services and care
 in hospitals. I felt you needed to know of my experience at Jamaica Hospital.
  I tell everyone how wonderful you all were to us during a 
  very difficult time in our lives.</font></p>

I recently had a nine day stay at Jamaica Hospital and I wanted to express how impressed
 I was with the level of care I received from everyone I encountered. The Trauma Center
  saved my life! I found it amazing and I am grateful that it services my community.</font></p>

I was recently returning home from vacation with my brother when he suffered a
 medical emergency at JFK Airport. He was transported to Jamaica Hospital where
  he died a week later on the Hospice Unit. During that week, I was able to draw
   the following conclusions about the care administered by the ICU and Palliative Care staff.

There is consistent coordination among healthcare professionals who treated
 my brother, There is regular communication with patients and families, you
 have a culture of safety for patients, and your residents and nurses are well trained.

At a time when I was experiencing an acute sense of loss and displacement,
 I will always remember the care and compassion of dedicated professionals.
  My experiences confirm my belief that my brother received the best possible 
  care at Jamaica Hospital.</font></p>
